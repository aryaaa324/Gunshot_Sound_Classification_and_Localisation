# Gunshot_Sound_Classification_and_Localisation

This project focuses on developing a system for gunshot sound classification and localization, aimed at improving public safety and law enforcement efficiency. The system utilizes advanced audio signal processing and machine learning techniques to classify gunshot sounds by identifying the type of firearm, determining the Direction of Arrival (DOA) of the sound, and estimating the shooter's location using time delay of arrival (TDOA) methods.

Objectives:
1. Gunshot Classification:
->Identify the type of firearm (e.g., handgun, rifle, shotgun) based on acoustic characteristics of the gunshot sound.
->Use machine learning or deep learning models trained on a dataset of gunshot audio samples.

2. Direction of Arrival (DOA) Estimation:
->Analyze the sound's phase and amplitude differences across multiple microphones in an array.

3. Localization using TDOA:
->Employ the Time Difference of Arrival (TDOA) method to calculate the location of the shooter.
->Use the time delay between microphones to triangulate the position of the sound source in a 2D or 3D space.
